#' Check cassette names
#'
#' @export
#' @param pattern (character) regex pattern for file paths to check.
#' this is done inside of `tests/testthat/`. default: "test-"
#' @param behavior (character) "stop" (default) or "warning". if "warning",
#' we use `immediate.=TRUE` so the warning happens at the top of your
#' tests rather than you seeing it after tests have run (as would happen
#' by default)
#' @details This function is meant to be run during your tests, from a
#' `helper-pkgname.R` file inside the `tests/testthat` directory. It only
#' checks that cassette names are not duplicated. A helper function 
#' `check_cassette_name()` runs inside [insert_cassette()] that checks
#' that cassettes do not have: spaces, file extensions, unaccepted
#' characters (slashes)
#' @section Cassette names:
#' - Should be meaningful so that it's obvious to you what test/function
#' they relate to. Meaningful names are important so that you can quickly
#' determine to what test file or test block a cassette belongs. Note that
#' vcr cannot check that your cassette names are meaningful.
#' - Should not be duplicated. Duplicated cassette names would lead to
#' a test using the wrong cassette.
#' - Should not have spaces. Spaces can lead to problems in using file paths.
#' - Should not include a file extension. vcr handles file extensions for
#' the user.
#' - Should not have slashes. Slashes can lead to problems in using file paths.
