  name,
  dir = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{name}{The name of the cassette. This is used to name a file on
disk, so it must be valid file name.}

\item{dir}{The directory where the cassette will be stored. If unspecified,
(and hasn't been set in \code{\link[=vcr_configure]{vcr_configure()}}) will use \code{test_path("_vcr")}.}

\item{record}{Record mode that dictates how HTTP requests/responses are
recorded. Possible values are:
\itemize{
\item \strong{once}, the default: Replays recorded interactions, records new ones
if no cassette exists, and errors on new requests if cassette exists.
\item \strong{none}: Replays recorded interactions, and errors on any new requests.
Guarantees that no HTTP requests occur.
\item \strong{new_episodes}: Replays recorded interactions and always records new
ones, even if similar interactions exist.
\item \strong{all}: Never replays recorded interactions, always recording new.
Useful for re-recording outdated responses or logging all HTTP requests.
}}

\item{match_requests_on}{Character vector of request matchers used to
determine which recorded HTTP interaction to replay. The default matches
on the \code{"method"}, \code{"uri"}, and either \code{"body"} (if present)
or \code{"body_json"} (if the content-type is \code{application/json}).

The full set of possible values are:
\itemize{
\item \code{method}: the HTTP method.
\item \code{uri}: the complete request URI, excluding the port.
\item \code{uri_with_port}: the complete request URI, including the port.
\item \code{host}: the \strong{host} component of the URI.
\item \code{path}: the \strong{path} component of the URI.
\item \code{query}: the \strong{query} component of the URI.
\item \code{body}: the request body.
\item \code{body_json}: the request body, parsed as JSON.
\item \code{header}: all request headers.
}

If more than one is specified, all components must match in order for the
request to match. If not supplied, defaults to \code{c("method", "uri")}.

Note that the request header and body will only be included in the
cassette if  \code{match_requests_on} includes "header" or "body" respectively.
This keeps the recorded request as lightweight as possible.}

\item{serialize_with}{(string) Which serializer to use:
\code{"yaml"} (the default), \code{"json"}, or \code{"qs2"}.}

\item{preserve_exact_body_bytes}{(logical) Force a binary (base64)
representation of the request and response bodies? By default, vcr
will look at the \code{Content-Type} header to determine if this is necessary,
but if it doesn't work you can set \code{preserve_exact_body_bytes = TRUE} to
force it.}

\item{re_record_interval}{(integer) How frequently (in seconds) the
cassette should be re-recorded. Default: \code{NULL} (not re-recorded).}

\item{warn_on_empty}{(logical) Warn if the cassette is ejected but no interactions
have been recorded. Default: \code{NULL} (inherits from global configuration).}

\value{
A \link{Cassette}, invisibly.

Generally you should not need to use these functions, instead preferring
\code{\link[=use_cassette]{use_cassette()}} or \code{\link[=local_cassette]{local_cassette()}}

\section{Cassette options}{


Default values for arguments controlling cassette behavior are
inherited from vcr's global configuration. See \code{\link[=vcr_configure]{vcr_configure()}} for a
complete list of options and their default settings. You can override these
options for a specific cassette by changing an argument's value to something
other than \code{NULL} when calling either \code{insert_cassette()} or
\code{use_cassette()}.
