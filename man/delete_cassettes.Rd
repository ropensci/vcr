\title{Delete cassettes by prefix}
\usage{
delete_cassettes(prefix, type = c("tests", "examples", "vignettes"))
}
\arguments{
\item{prefix}{(character) The prefix to match cassette names. This will
match cassette names that start with this string. For example, \code{prefix = "api"}
will match cassettes like \code{"api-get.yml"}, \code{"api-post.yml"}, etc. To match
a single cassette exactly, include the full name without the extension
(e.g., \code{prefix = "my-cassette"} will match \code{"my-cassette.yml"} and
\code{"my-cassette-2.yml"}).}

\item{type}{(character) The type(s) of cassettes to delete. Can be one or more of:
\itemize{
\item \strong{tests} (default): Delete cassettes from the directory configured with
\code{\link[=vcr_configure]{vcr_configure()}}. If not configured, defaults to \verb{tests/testthat/_vcr/}.
\item \strong{examples}: Delete cassettes in \verb{inst/_vcr/}
\item \strong{vignettes}: Delete cassettes in \verb{vignettes/_vcr/}
}}
}
\value{
A character vector of the deleted cassette paths (invisibly). If no
cassettes match the prefix, returns \code{character(0)}.
}
\description{
Delete cassettes that match a given prefix from the specified directory
(tests, examples, or vignettes). This is useful for cleaning up old or
unwanted cassettes in batch.
}
\details{
The function will:
\enumerate{
\item Look for cassettes (\code{.yml}, \code{.yaml}, \code{.json}, or \code{.qs2} extensions)
in the specified directory or directories.
\item Match cassettes whose names start with the given prefix.
\item Delete all matching cassettes.
\item Report how many cassettes were deleted.
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Delete all test cassettes starting with "api-"
delete_cassettes("api-", type = "tests")

# Delete all example cassettes starting with "github"
delete_cassettes("github", type = "examples")

# Delete a specific vignette cassette (and any cassettes starting with that name)
delete_cassettes("intro-example", type = "vignettes")

# Delete cassettes from multiple locations
delete_cassettes("old-", type = c("tests", "examples"))
}
}
