\usage{
check_cassette_names(pattern = "test-", behavior = "stop")
}
\arguments{
\item{pattern}{(character) regex pattern for file paths to check.
this is done inside of \verb{tests/testthat/}. default: "test-"}

\item{behavior}{(character) "stop" (default) or "warning". if "warning",
we use \code{immediate.=TRUE} so the warning happens at the top of your
tests rather than you seeing it after tests have run (as would happen
by default)}
}
\description{
Check cassette names
}
\details{
Cassette names:
\itemize{
\item Should be meaningful so that it’s obvious to you what test/function
they relate to. Meaningful names are important so that you can
quickly determine to what test file or test block a cassette
belongs. Note that vcr cannot check that your cassette names are
meaningful.
\item Should not be duplicated. Duplicated cassette names would lead to a
test using the wrong cassette.
\item Should not have spaces. Spaces can lead to problems in using file
paths.
\item Should not include a file extension. vcr handles file extensions for
the user.
\item Should not have illegal characters that can lead to problems in
using file paths: ‘/’, ‘?’, ‘<’, ‘>’, ‘\’, ‘:’, ’*‘,’|‘, and’"’
\item Should not have control characters, e.g., \verb{\n}
\item Should not have just dots, e.g., \code{.} or \code{..}
\item Should not have Windows reserved words, e.g., \code{com1}
\item Should not have trailing dots
\item Should not be longer than 255 characters
}

\code{vcr::check_cassette_names()} is meant to be run during your tests, from
a \code{setup-pkgname.R} file inside the \code{tests/testthat} directory. It only
checks that cassette names are not duplicated. A helper function
\code{check_cassette_name()} runs inside
\code{\link[=insert_cassette]{insert_cassette()}} that checks that cassettes
do not have: spaces, file extensions, unaccepted characters (slashes)
}
