Most APIs require some sort of authentication, which requires a secret: something that you know, and the server knows, but no one else does. Because vcr saves requests and responses to disk, you need to make sure that you don't accidentally reveal any secrets to the world. 

The most common places to worry about secrets are in requests, because you need to tell the server who you are. There are three places that a secret can turn up:

* In the request headers. The most common way to authenticate with an API is through the `Authorization` header.

* In a query parameter. 

* In the request body.

It's also possible, but rarer, for you to get a secret back in the response body. This typically occurs if you're creating some new resource. 

Because request headers are the most common place for secrets to crop up, vcr takes effort to make sure you don't accidentally expose them. Firstly, vcr will only record headers to disk if you've specifically requested to use them for matching (with `match_requests_on = "header`"). Secondly, even if you do match on headers, vcr will automatically redact the `Authorization` header.

If your secrets live somewhere else, read on to ensure that you don't save them in your casssettes.

## Query parameters

Some (poorly designed) APIs include secrets in the URL. (This is bad practice because URLs are recorded in all sorts of places like logs, browser history, and bookmarks.) You can use the `filter_query_parameters` config to strip away these secrets. There are three way to use it:

1. Completely drop a parameter.

    ```R
    vcr_configure(filter_query_parameters = "user")
    ```

1. Replace parameter value with a specified value:

    ```R
    vcr_configure(filter_query_parameters = list(api_key = "<api-key>"))
    ```

1. Replace the parameter value when writing to disk and restore another value when reading:

    ```R
    vcr_configure(
      filter_query_parameters = list(api_key = c(Sys.getenv("MY_API_KEY"), "foo"))
    )
    ```

Beware of your `match_requests_on` option when using this filter. If you
filter out a query parameter it's probably a bad idea to match on `query`
given that there is no way for vcr to restore the exact http request
from your cassette after one or more query parameters is removed or changed.
One way you could filter a query parameter and still match on query or
at least on the complete uri is to use replacement behavior (a named list),
but instead of `list(a="b")` use two values `list(a=c("b","c"))`, where
"c" is the string to be stored in the cassette. You could of course replace
those values with values from environment variables so that you obscure
the real values if your code is public.

## Request and response headers

By default, vcr doesn't save request headers to disk, so this section only applies if you're using `match_requests_on = "header"` or the secrets are found in the respond headers. 

vcr provides two config options that lets you modified request and response headers: `filter_request_headers` and `filter_response_headers`. You can use these options to either remove a header entirely by supplying a character vector:

```{r}
vcr_configure(filter_request_headers = "password")
vcr_configure(filter_response_headers = c("secret1", "secret2"))
```

Or you can use a named list, where the name is the header to modify and the values is the value to replace it with:

```{r}
vcr_configure(filter_request_headers = list(password = "<password>"))
vcr_configure(filter_response_headers = list(
  secret1 = "<secret1>", 
  secret2 = "<secret2>"
))
```

If you use httr2, note that vcr will automatically handle redacted headers created by `httr2::req_headers_redacted()`.

## URL, headers, and body

If neither of the previous techniques work, there's the nuclear option: `filter_sensitive_data`. This is applied to every component of the request and the response that is serialized to disk. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
vcr_configure(
  filter_sensitive_data = list("<api_key>" = Sys.getenv('MY_API_KEY'))
)
```

This is a bidirectional replacement, so that when writing your API key is replaced with `<api_key>`, and when reading `<api_key>` is replaced with your API key.
