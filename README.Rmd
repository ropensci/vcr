Easier HTTP testing! Record HTTP requests and responses on disk and replay them for the unit tests of your R package, to make them independent from any connection, faster, and more complete. An R port of the Ruby gem [vcr](https://github.com/vcr/vcr)

## Elevator pitch

```{r child='man/rmdhunks/elevator-pitch.Rmd'} 
```

## Docs

Check out the [HTTP testing book](https://books.ropensci.org/http-testing) and the [vcr vignettes](https://docs.ropensci.org/vcr/articles/).

## Supported HTTP libraries

* [crul](https://docs.ropensci.org/crul)
* [httr](https://httr.r-lib.org/)

## Getting Started

```{r child='man/rmdhunks/setup.Rmd'} 
```

## Usage

```{r child='man/rmdhunks/basic-usage.Rmd'} 
```


## Terminology

```{r child='man/rmdhunks/glossary.Rmd'} 
```

## Workflows

```{r child='man/rmdhunks/workflows.Rmd'} 
```

### How it works in lots of detail

See the [vignette about internals](https://docs.ropensci.org/vcr/articles/internals.html)

### Just want to mock and not store on disk?

You're looking for [webmockr][]., that vcr itself uses. 
`webmockr` only matches requests based on criteria you choose, but does not cache HTTP interactions to disk as `vcr` does.
